# Arpyggiator

Loop station meets arpeggiators in python.

See requirements.txt for needed packages for installation.

## Ideas

- [x] One loop should have length max(all rows) (merger les arpeggios de TOUT, jouer un seul loop.)
- [x] An arp should be mutable (i mean silencable) so we can have pauses
- [x] Save & load
- [X] Remove Arp & Instrument row 
- [X] Total volume
- [ ] Effets de son
- [x] Adjust front end so it shows where we are on the beat atm
- [ ] Report
- [x] Move arps left and right
- [x] Duplicate
- [x] Variant option 0 to play a silent sound (pauses in arpeggios possible)
- [x] Needed packages for program installation? (requirements.txt?)
- [x] No mode (all buttons deactivated)
- [x] Mute whole row by key press (1-0, [Y/Z], U, I, O, P for all 16 channels)

## Bugs

- [x] Volume
- [ ] duplicate: variant ticks
- [ ] Deactivate chords Shortcuts if not active (they should recognize if it is their mode)

## Optional

- [ ] Small arp view (make height smaller if row not selectedand replace by some other thing)
- [ ] Small arp view (make width smaller)
- [ ] Zoom?
- [x] Change soundfont?
- [ ] Limit to max_rows rows (16)
- [ ] Arp volume?
- [x] Vertical scrolling, scrolling in general
